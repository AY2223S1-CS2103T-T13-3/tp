## Introduction
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

CLInkedIn is a **desktop address book application made for Recruiting and Hiring Managers to keep track of candidates and their job applications.** The application is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, CLInkedIn can get your recruitment tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Useful Notations

While exploring CLInkedIn's features with this user guide, do take note of these symbols used in the user guide and what information they represent.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :----: | ------- |
| :information_source: | Important information |
| :exclamation: | Warning or caution |
| :bulb: | Additional information such as tips or notes |
| :wrench: | Help with common technical issues |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java [`11`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `CLInkedIn.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your `CLInkedIn` application.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

- The command word is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `add` is the same as `ADD` or `aDd`.

</div>

## Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page, as well as a list of commands and their descriptions.
Alternatively, you can obtain help on a specific command by typing `help` followed by the command name.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format:

- `help` will open the help window in a separate window containing a list of commands and their usages.
- `help COMMAND` will display the command usage for COMMAND in the result display.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**
`help` will automatically parse any inputs given after the command word `help` as a command name. If the command name is invalid, an error message will be displayed in the result display.
</div>

Examples:

- `help` will open the help window.
- `help add` will display the usage of the `add` command.
- `help 123` will display an error message as `123` is not a valid command name.

## Adding/Deleting contacts in CLInkedIn

The following functions deal with adding or deleting contacts from your address book in CLInkedIn.

### Adding a person: `add`
